You know what it represents.  Here's the cons: Cheaters Questionable Hitreg Baffling Inaccuracy mechanics Stagnant content cycle and low map pool variety  Here's the pros: It's Counter Strike  There's simply no other FPS like it. Almost all the mechanics combine together to create an experience that is truly stellar for anyone who has an interest for high tension, high skill, and high reward FPS games. CS is not for the faint of heart. In fact, I would say a good majority of people shouldn't even be playing it. But for the truly hardcore, there really isn't any other option. As WarOwl says, "your character doesn't get better, you get better". A game with that kind of pure player involved skill progression, along with mechanics refined over two decades of innovation is something that any hardcore PC FPS player should play. Yes I recommend it. The game is frustrating, it's unloved by it's developers, and you are gonna wonder why you even try to play it when at times it feels so broken.

I'm sure you've heard of it. I'm sure you even own it. You know about the toxic community and the rampant cheaters and I'm sure you even learned the inticacies of pronouncing u0430u043au0443u0441 u044cu0442u044fu043bu0431 while playing. That's however not the reason why this is a negative review. The plain reason is, this game is boring as hell.  Sure the competitiveness is good when you're in a nice outfit, guns handle nice and there is a high skill ceiling. But there is not enough variation to tickle your fancy for a long time. There used to be 'Operations' that brought some nice and refreshing maps into the pool every now and then, but the operations seem to have died a silent death the equal we haven't seen since Episode 3. So that leaves you to playing the same maps over and over again.   Every now and then they get a face lift and sometimes they even add a previous Operation map to some insignificant map pool and that's it. The rest of the variation comes from cosmetics that you have to pay for because you only get $ 0.03 sticker drops. Every couple of months they add another insignificant type of cosmetic that used to be free in 1.6 and Source (i.e. skins and graffiti) that lack any originality. I'm sure they will add tattoos next.  Aside from matchmaking the whole game seems to be dead. Casual is just a chore. Public servers are tucked away in some dark corner of the in-game browser. What's left is the routine of grinding the same maps over and over again into unimaginable boredom. The only redeeming factor is you can sell loot for ridiculous prices on the market, but to be honest you don't even need the game for that.

It's simple : This game's physics is so wrong from many different points of view that it should not be taken seriously, but you can't because it's a competitive game which requires full dedication in a match to win,and besides of that , you know that in the end you're spending your time with it. How physics are wrong in this game ? here, let me tell you some scenarios i still remember:  - dropping from altitude lowers armor ?!?!??!?! - shot him right in the face from 3 meters with Nova , his head goes a little backwards with the dink sound , he slides right, he onetaps me. -M4A4 ,very close range, recoil control , more than 15 bullets shot right at him;litteraly those bullets did not had where to go but in him, but somehow , he takes almost no damage and he kills me -AWP , when you peak slowly with SHIFT, you need to stop for about 0.2 seconds before you shoot to be accurate, and when you exit fast and you stop moving , the accuracy gets in faster ?!?!?!?!   Conclusion : Can't get yourself better in this game ? Don't worry , it's maybe because your brain continually refuses to get used with the misery of physics this game has.

This game is enjoyable however the harder you try the more dissapointed and ashamed you will be of yourself if you fail. This game is to be played leniently and the only thing you would achieve if you try hard and succeed is the gratitude from your teammates. I suggest that you try hard to a certain extent where you can laugh it off if you die to someone else and not scream bloody murder, although it is understandable to be serious in a game where you are betting hundreds or thousands of dollars it wouldnt be so much so if unintentionally your teammate makes a mistake that causes you to yell at him until oblivion.

It's been so many years into the game's life and there are still too many cheaters/crazy insane pro wallbang headshot smurfs at LEM+ level. It's also not uncommon to experience blatant cheaters at my smurf's rank (MG2) but not nearly as much as LEM, even LE is pretty bad. Both of my accounts have good prime status. Every month or 2 I decide to play some games of CS because it's a good game but I only get reminded the hard way of why I stopped playing in the first place.",             "steam_purchase": true,             "timestamp_created": 1571447161,             "timestamp_updated": 1571447161,             "voted_up": false,             "votes_funny": 0,             "votes_up": 3,             "weighted_vote_score": "0.536423861980438232",             "written_during_early_access": false         },         {             "author": {                 "last_played": 1572838913,                 "num_games_owned": 1,                 "num_reviews": 1,                 "playtime_forever": 6402,                 "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4019,                 "steamid": "76561198995861847"             },             "comment_count": 0,             "language": "english",             "received_for_free": false,             "recommendationid": "55756664",             "review": "Too many fucking cheaters!!!!!!!!!",             "steam_purchase": true,             "timestamp_created": 1571981076,             "timestamp_updated": 1571981076,             "voted_up": true,             "votes_funny": 0,             "votes_up": 3,             "weighted_vote_score": "0.536398470401763916",             "written_during_early_access": false         },         {             "author": {                 "last_played": 1572203407,                 "num_games_owned": 68,                 "num_reviews": 2,                 "playtime_forever": 61383,                 "playtime_last_two_weeks": 171,                 "steamid": "76561198382571865"             },             "comment_count": 0,             "language": "english",             "received_for_free": false,             "recommendationid": "55628014",             "review": "Addictive! But has a lot of cheaters since release. After the game went f2p the cheaters base just exploded. Getting cheaters almost every other game even in high trust factor those cheaters have 5+ years old steam account and service medals in each year. I am really disappointed valve doing little to nothing about this game's cheater problem.  This is the best FPS game ever made but ruined by those cheaters. I still recommend this game but I didn't recommend valve official matchmaking. Atleast faceit is cheaters free with better servers but new players will have difficulty getting into faceit due to huge skill gap.  As like any other fps games this game is also easy to get into but hard to master.  This game took away my social life.
